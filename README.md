Hi, I'm Miley! _(I also go by Ethan or Dani, or any of my cosplay/character names!)_

I do.. uhh... stuff!!

This part is for Ponytown.. feel free to hide behind me or cuddle, I don't mind! You don't have to ask first.
I prefer others interacting first, as I'm autistic and extremely socially anxious. Although I can seem a little prickly at first, please don't be afraid! I swear I can actually be a bit of a chatterbox!!

I'm also an artist! I draw shit, so feel free to ask me about it! I'd be glad to rant to you about silly little guys I doodle from time to time. I don't consider myself a part of fandoms, but I do draw
a lot of characters from my interests and special interests. 

Side note, if you ever want to rant to someone, feel free to rant to me!! I'm okay with it!! I like hearing people yap about stuff they like, and hey, new thing to check out! This also includes negative stuff, too. Like, if you just wanna let shit out, I'll listen. I may not be the best at comforting, but I _will_ listen, and do my best to understand.

Completely unrelated, _other_ side note- please don't fucking stalk me! I've now had two different people do this to my socials, and it obviously makes me EXTREMELY uncomfortable. If you have something to say, please just say it, and don't do this. So long as you don't have malicious intent (which I doubt), I won't be mad. Just please, for the love of god, don't stalk me.
