**_BYF/BYI (BEFORE YOU FOLLOW/INTERACT)_**

hi there- i'm miley, but feel free to also call me ethan or maverick. i am diagnosed with various disorder(s) and conditions, so please be patient with me, as i'm often very impulsive with my words publicly and greatly struggle with social interactions. i suffer very extreme mood swings and opinion changes, so i apologize in advance for a lot of things i may claim i'm against one day and then say i'm totally alright with the next, as i'm working on gaining a better sense of control over my opinions and emotions.

i don't have a hard dni, as i much prefer blocking freely, but people i will be avoidant of are pro/com/darkshippers, many under 16 and over 23, people who make self-injury or suicide jokes, and those who generally just don't respect people's rights and identities (racism, sexism, the likes). i do my best to be respectful however, due to many internal struggles, i may come off very strongly (negatively) on some harmless topics such as fictionkin and otherkin. please *don't* take my word, as it is hardly a reflection of my own beliefs: i tend to say negative things i don't mean on a whim when i'm on social media. i swear i'm not like this in person ^^'


**_STUFF FOR PT/PONYTOWN_**

i know i don't talk to people a lot agh.. but please, always feel free 2 sit with me. i know i have this massive "byi" thing going on, but seriously i'm really jus. just another dude. i consider everyone a friend, and _none_ of that shows when i'm actually talking with people (if it helps, you can get a better vibe of who i actually am as a person with my lovemail page). i care greatly about other people's feelings, which is why i'm so public about how i can act on social media sometimes- i know what i say (about kinnies specifically, yes) can be hurtful, which is why i'm essentially putting a massive warning label on myself.
