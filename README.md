hi! i'm miley, but if we're friends or close in any way (even accquaintances), feel free to also call me ethan.
i'm kinda in the midst of figuring myself and my values out right now, apologies.. but please, don't be afraid to start up a convo with me! i'm dx with severe social anxiety, so i may be afraid to do it myself (nothing personal!!).

i have *no dni!!* shocker i know considering some stuff ive been vehemently agasint recently. but really, ive kinda come to realize- why should it matter? i don't have to agree with every opinion of any given person, and i can still be respectful towards them anyway. if it's something comforting to you, and you aren't forcing it upon anyone or being a dick for the sake of it, i mean hey; who am i to stop ya! because of this i hide and block freely, though genuinely like the only people i have perma hidden are the actual weirdos (bodily anatomy ponies on the safe server, ifykyk)

if u wanna hang with me on roblox or anything, here's my user! i'm a lot more active on here and steam, so feel free to say hi if you wanna anytime :]
