HI PLS PLS READ if i promised u art on straw!!: https://rentry.co/whyicantdraw


hi, name's miley! i don't really have a preference for pronouns, so i don't mind any. i'm diagnosed with quite a few things (mainly severe social anxiety), please go easy on me- i may not be the best at interacting.

(i know i dont have my sexuality many places, but consider me aroace!)

i flip-flop between fixations a lot, and never consider myself a part of any fandoms, though i will draw stuff for things i'm interested in. i have no dni, and can block pretty liberally if someone makes me uncomfortable. fun fact; my profile pictures are always drawn by me! i like matching with subzero, so i'll usually do them for that (if i can get his lazy ASS to cghange it /j)

i speak french (canadian) and english fluently. i'm canadian/icelandic.

ponytown stuff specifically: ALWAYS feel free 2 sit with me!!!!! i love when people do, so you'll usually see c+h (cuddle/hide) or touch comf in my name (but i'm cool w/ it even if i dont!!). i swear i don't bite, even if i don't say much!! i also wanna say that my statuses don't really mean a lot, and unless i directly have "dni unless .." written, i''m always fine with being approached.
