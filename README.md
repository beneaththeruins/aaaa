hi, name's miley! i don't really have a preference for pronouns, so i don't mind any. i'm diagnosed with quite a few things (mainly severe social anxiety), please go easy on me- i may not be the best at interacting.

i flip-flop between fixations a lot, and never consider myself a part of any fandoms, though i will draw stuff for things i'm interested in. i have no dni, and can block pretty liberally if someone makes me uncomfortable.
