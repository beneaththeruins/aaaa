hi! i'm miley, but if we're friends or close in any way (even accquaintances), feel free to also call me ethan.
i'm kinda in the midst of figuring myself and my values out right now, apologies.. but please, don't be afraid to start up a convo with me! i'm dx with severe social anxiety, so i may be afraid to do it myself (nothing personal!!).

if u wanna hang with me on roblox or anything, here's my user! i'm a lot more active on here and steam, so feel free to say hi if you wanna anytime :]
