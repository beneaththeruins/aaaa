hi- please iwec (interact with extra care and caution) as of now.

i usually never talk about things of this nature, but as of late, i've been struggling a _lot_ with traumas and my identity in my personal life. i'm very likely to be quiet in terms of texting and frequently nonverbal in other settings.

i apologize in advance if i come across as rude, however i would like some space right now, which means i may not want to interact with a majority of people aside from caz.
