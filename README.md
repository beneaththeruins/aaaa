**_BYF/BYI (BEFORE YOU FOLLOW/INTERACT)_**

hi there- i'm miley, but feel free to also call me ethan or maverick. i am diagnosed with various disorder(s) and conditions, so please be patient with me, as i'm often very impulsive in my words and greatly struggle with social interactions. i suffer very extreme mood swings and opinion changes, so i apologize in advance for a lot of things i may claim i'm against one day and then act like i'm totally alright with the next, as i'm working on gaining a better sense of control over my opinions and emotions.

i don't have a hard dni, as i much prefer blocking freely, but people i will be avoidant of are pro/com/darkshippers, many under 16 and over 23, people who make self-injury or suicide jokes, and those who generally just don't respect people's rights and identities (racism, sexism, the likes). i do my best to be respectful however, due to many internal struggles, i may come off very strongly (negatively) on some harmless topics such as fictionkin and otherkin. please *don't* take my word, as it is hardly a reflection of my own beliefs: i tend to say negative things i don't mean on a whim.
