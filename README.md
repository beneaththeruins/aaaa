hi, name's miley! i don't really have a preference for pronouns, so i don't mind any. i'm diagnosed with quite a few things (mainly severe social anxiety), please go easy on me- i may not be the best at interacting.

(i know i dont have my sexuality many places, but consider me aroace!)

i flip-flop between fixations a lot, and never consider myself a part of any fandoms, though i will draw stuff for things i'm interested in. i have no dni, and can block pretty liberally if someone makes me uncomfortable. fun fact; my profile pictures are always drawn by me! i like matching with subzero.

i speak french (canadian) and english fluently. i'm canadian/icelandic.
